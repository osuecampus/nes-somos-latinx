However, away from home and at school almost everything we handled in English. Apart from language there were also differences between customs and small details between the typical American culture and the culture of my family. It is much more difficult to navigate environments and relationships for someone who does not know 'how the current flows.' This is why it’s so valuable to know ourselves well and learn how the ideas and ways that we bring are perceived by other people; from the way we behave, dress, communicate, work, and even our expectations towards others. It is equally valuable and important to know the cultures of others. For me, understanding all that over time gave me an advantage in school, clubs, college, and even in my work because now I can adapt more easily to the people and environments that surround me. This was something I started to realized when I was young, during elementary school when I realized that somehow I had a double-personality or double-identity. I was Ruben at home with my family and close friends, but at school and out of the home I was Jose. My way of being and of thinking changed depending on where and with whom I was. Eventually I became more aware of these changes. Today my understanding of others and myself brings me ease and advantages that I would not have without this knowledge.

Not because, I think highly about myself but because I still can't believe it! Can't believe that I'm attending college and I'm a couple of steps closer to becoming a first generation student to graduate! My parents immigrated to the United States in 1986 and received their residency in 1988 during Ronald Reagan’s presidency. I always say that this key moment in their life is what opened many opportunities for my family and I. Because of this they were able to stay in the states without fear of deportation, and began their life here where my siblings and I were born. Even though we had an open door to many opportunities, it was never easy. My parents never attended college, nevertheless finished elementary school. \n\nThey didn't know how they would send us to college, they themselves had never even stepped foot on a college campus. This didn't stop them from dreaming and constantly reminding us that they came here to give us a better life. My parents advice has always been with me, I can always hear my parents saying \"echale ganas, tu puedes, vas a ser doctora, licenciada lo que tu quieras.\" They didn't know how to get us to college but they know the importance of pursuing higher education. With sacrifice and hard work my parents dreams came true. Both my brother and I enrolled to Oregon State University. Being a first generation college student was hard, it was difficult o navigate the education system. It was even harder to be away from home, leaving my house to go to college came with a lot of guilt, I felt guilty for leaving and not being at home to help out in the household and finances.</p> <p>You see, my siblings and I grew up in the fields.  We would go to the fields with my parents and pick from a very young age, my mom would sell food to the field workers and we would collect cans to sell every chance we got. This was our living, this was all we knew, my father didn't know how to read and both my parents didn't know english, how did we make it out? How did we make it here? It wasn't easy, it was extremely hard, all the odds were against us. But it was possible. \n\nToday, I'm not only living my parents dreams but also mine. Going to college, has been a blessing in disguise, there is always something or someone that is going to want to stop us, that will make it harder for us, it's really up to us not to give up and keep pushing forward. \n\nEducation is one of the most important elements in the context of social justice. If education is a mechanism to elevate communities, access to education should be a public policy and a government priority. Education may also be a tool of segregation, as we may see in racial/ethnic disparities in graduation rates, access to higher education and college retention.</p> <p>In the United States groups of color, including the Latinx community, have had very low rates of school graduation and participation in higher education compared to others groups.</p> <p>These indicators do not speak of an inferior community or lack of commitment of the families.  These numbers actually represent the responsibility of the institutions to fight inequity. \n\nLet’s continue, but first, two important terms..."

At home my mom would speak in English with me most of the time, also in school and classes I would also speak English but at home it was a mix of languages and communications, one screaming over the other, using a little bit of “Spanglish,” A lot of Spanish here. My grandfather would always correct me with my words. When I would say “apoyo” oh my god he would always correct me and say it’s “apoyo.” Something so wonderful that I didn’t think was different, it didn’t seem different and now when I think about my life it’s a piece of my history. I think about how I’m raising my children different, and how i can pass on to them a little bit of that language, how can I give them that experience because it’s an incredible memory of mine. Looking at how families talk to one another and how they communicate-- and also how they share with the language."

For example in in New Jersey, India is the top country of birth among immigrants. In Maine, Montana, New Hampshire , Vermont and North Dakota, Canada is the top country of birth for immigrants and in Hawaii and Alaska Filipinos account for a large share of immigrants. Immigrants from Ireland, England, Germany, Italy and many other european countries were part of large immigrant groups in the last two centuries, many of them after the first and second war. Millions of immigrants come as well from Asian and Eastern Europe. In California for example in 1860, 40% of the immigrants were Chinese in contrast with Meanwhile, New York and New Jersey where in 1910, 30% of the immigrants were from Russia and the USSR. Congress passed in 1965 a legislation to open the nation’s borders, immigrants have largely hailed from Latin America and Asia. In 2012, there were four states (California, New York, New Jersey and Florida) in which about one-in-five or more people are foreign born.Mexico is the birthplace of 28% (or 11.6 million) of all immigrants in the U.S. Immigrants born in Mexico account for more than half of all of the foreign born in five states: New Mexico 72%, Arizona 58%, Texas 58%, Idaho 53% and Oklahoma 51%."

I was born and raised in a small town called Raspadura, a poor village of less than 2000 people located in Choco, province of Colombia. Since I was a child, my parents taught me the importance of studying as hard to develop a complete education, earn knowledge, make better decisions, achieve a professional career, and reach a better quality of life. They also taught me the importance of using and preserving my mother and father's surname to honor my ancestors, as many Spanish-speaking countries use to do it. Something difficult to handle when you are living in an English-speaking country such as the United States. Latin American descendants’ preference for using their father and mother first surname occasionally results in serious legal problems.The American laws operate on the assumption that each person has a first name, middle name, and last name.  The last name is normally inherited solely from the father and is assumed to be the only surname. However, using our father and mother’s first surname also gives us historical and legal advantages. For example, keeping alive both branch of our family line or spending less time during immigration checks when you are leaving or arriving at the United States. If I had decided to use my name under the American rule; Jose Guerrero, my record in an airport would probably match with many people who have the same name. But, because I decided to keep using and preserving my mother and father's surname, the information will be narrowed down just to my real and unique name. Further, I can be able to trace back my entire family line.Therefore, I still refuse to reduce my name to the American style and I still feel weird to be called or sign a document without using my original name. Because I believe that every individual’s identity deserves to be acknowledged and respected!"

We have always had horses. One day we decided to have our horses here in the United States. When we decided to have horses here we met a lot of people and luckily I met a man named Antonio Huerta and he taught me alot about the “charreria” besides what my dad taught me about horses. I have always said let’s not lose the customs of our mexican parents and we should always be prideful of being mexican and put on the clothes right because that’s what represents our lives."
